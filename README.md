## React.js Todo List Application

A simple application that keeps tracks of tasks you want to complete. Simply enter the tasks you want to append onto the list and delete them when you're done! The tasks will automatically be saved using cookies, so one can exit the tab without having to worry about losing your data.

---
*Built using **React, Javascript**, HTML, CSS, and Materialize.css*
